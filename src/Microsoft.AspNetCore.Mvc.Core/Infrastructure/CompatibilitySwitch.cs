    // Guide to making breaking behavior changes in MVC:
    //
    // Hello, if you're reading this, you're probably trying to make a change in behavior in MVC in a minor
    // version. Every change in behavior is a breaking change to someone, even if a feature was buggy or
    // broken in some scenarios.
    //
    // To help make things easier for current users, we don't automatically opt users into breaking changes when
    // they upgrade applications to a new minor version of ASP.NET Core. It's a separate choice to opt in to new
    // behaviors in a minor release.
    //
    // To make things better for future users, we also want to provide an easy way for applications to get
    // access to the new behaviors. We make changes when they are improvments, and if we're changing something
    // we've already shipped, it must add value for all of our users (eventually). To this end, new applications
    // created using the template are always opted in to the 'current' version.
    //
    // This means that all changes in behavior should be opt-in. 
    //
    // -----
    // 
    // Moving on from general philosophy, here's how to implement a behavior change and corresponding 
    // compatibility switch. 
    //
    // Add a new property on options that uses a CompatibilitySwitch<T> as a backing field. Make sure the
    // new switch is exposed by implementing IEnumerable<ICompatibilitySwitch> on the options class. Pass the
    // property name to the CompatibilitySwitch constructor using nameof.
    //
    // Choose a boolean value or a new enum type as the 'value' of the property.
    //
    // If the new property has a boolean value, it should be named something like `SuppressFoo` 
    // (if the new value deactivates some behavior) or like `AllowFoo` (if the new value enables some behavior).
    // Choose a name so that the old behavior equates to 'false'.
    //
    // If it's an enum, make sure you initialize the compatibility switch using the 
    // CompatibilitySwitch(string, value) constructor to make it obvious the correct value is passed in. It's 
    // a good idea to equate the original behavior with the default enum value as well.
    //
    // Then create (or modify) a subclass of ConfigureCompatibilityOptions appropriate for your options type. 
    // Override the DefaultValues property and provide appropriate values based on the value of the Version
    // property. If you just added this class, register it as an IPostConfigureOptions<TOptions> in DI.
