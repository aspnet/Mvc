    /// Consider two actions, 'A' and 'B' with the same action and controller name. Action 'A' only allows the
    /// HTTP POST method (via a constraint) and action 'B' has no constraints.
    ///
    /// If an incoming request is a POST, then 'A' is considered the best match because it both matches and
    /// has a constraint. If an incoming request uses any other verb, 'A' will not be valid for selection
    /// due to it's constraint, so 'B' is the best match.
    ///
    ///
    /// Action constraints are also grouped according to their order value. Any constraints with the same
    /// group value are considered to be part of the same application policy, and will be executed in the
    /// same stage.
    ///
    /// Stages run in ascending order based on the value of <see cref="Order"/>. Given a set of actions which
    /// are candidates for selection, the next stage to run is the lowest value of <see cref="Order"/> for any
    /// constraint of any candidate which is greater than the order of the last stage.
    ///
    /// Once the stage order is identified, each action has all of its constraints in that stage executed.
    /// If any constraint does not match, then that action is not a candidate for selection. If any actions
    /// with constraints in the current state are still candidates, then those are the 'best' actions and this
    /// process will repeat with the next stage on the set of 'best' actions. If after processing the
    /// subsequent stages of the 'best' actions no candidates remain, this process will repeat on the set of
    /// 'other' candidate actions from this stage (those without a constraint).
